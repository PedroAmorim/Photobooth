# Photobooth
Photobooth project for RaspberryPi with PiCamera and CUPS printer!

This projet is initialy a fork of [drumminhands/drumminhands_photobooth](https://github.com/drumminhands/drumminhands_photobooth).  
But we need some features that make a lot of breaking change and shouldn’t never be merged on upstream, so we created our own project.  
Thanks drumminhands to the initial project, it’s simple and really efficient! :)  

### Features:
* Create a picture with 2x2 photos like in photo booth
* Print picture with CUPS

### This requires:
* PiCamera -- http://picamera.readthedocs.org/
* CUPS -- https://www.cups.org/

### Instructions:
* Create your own config
`cp config-dist.py config.py`
